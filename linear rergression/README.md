In this I have tried to build the most basic Linear Regression model.<br>
All the plots in the <b>./results/</b> folder have been mentioned in the code as well for easier understanding and reproduction.
The dataset is avaiable in the <b>./dataset</b> folder.<br>
I have used <b>Convex Hull Algorithm</b> for outlier detection. I urge you to read up on it for further information and its working. The simplest explanation for it is that its the smallest convex polygon containing all the given points, where the input is an array of points specified by their x and y coordinates. The output is the convex hull of this set of points.
